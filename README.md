To run MaxGoodman.java as a stand alone file please note the following:

*You must instantiate MaxGoodman as an object, and pass in the matrix you wish solved as well as the length of the unique words you wish to find.
*After doing this you can call SolveMatrix() on your object, which returns a Long of number of unique words fitting the parameters found within the grid.

Please note the main.java class has an example instantiation with the problem gird, as well as a timer to measure relative performance.
